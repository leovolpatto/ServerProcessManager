# ServerProcessManager
A very quick and simple process manager that allows you to see what is running on your server and kill some processes. It is able to run in both Linux or Windows OS.

ServerProcessManager will run smoothly depending on your (security) configurations. 
It was tested on Win RT 8.1, Amazon AMI Linux, Ubuntu Server 14, Fedora 20 Workstation.  

Remember: THIS IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL TOOL. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. I CREATED IT JUST FOR FUN ON A FRIDAY EVENING.
